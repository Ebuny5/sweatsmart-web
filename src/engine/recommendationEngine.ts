/**
 * SweatSmart — HidroAlly Recommendation Engine (Definitive Edition)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the SINGLE engine. Do not create additional engines alongside this.
 *
 * Voice: HidroAlly — warm, clinical, companion-like. Think "brilliant
 * dermatologist who also genuinely cares about you as a warrior."
 *
 * Knowledge base integration:
 *   Ch.7  → Vasodilation-edema: swelling/tightness in palms/feet during episodes
 *   Ch.8  → Secondary paresthesia: numbness/tingling linked to nerve compression
 *   Ch.9  → Plantar fall risk: gait alteration, slippery surface danger
 *   Ch.10 → Aquagenic keratoderma: rapid wrinkling on water contact
 *   Ch.11 → Differential diagnosis: primary vs secondary, erythromelalgia, etc.
 *
 * Hard rules:
 *   1. Never mention body areas the user did not log
 *   2. Never recommend aluminium chloride for facial areas — ever
 *   3. Never output "and X more" — list all triggers in full
 *   4. Never use "GP" alone — write "dermatologist or general practitioner (GP)"
 *   5. Never repeat the same phrase across sections in the same report
 *   6. Parse the notes field — it is the richest data the user gives us
 *   7. Vary every output genuinely — no two reports should read the same
 *   8. No emojis on medical warnings or red-flag sections — warm ≠ trivial
 *   9. Output ends with HidroAlly CTA directing user to companion chat
