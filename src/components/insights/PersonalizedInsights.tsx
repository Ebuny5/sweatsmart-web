In humid conditions, sweat can't evaporate from your skin properly, so your body keeps producing more without the cooling relief it's expecting. This creates a frustrating loop: the more it sweats, the more uncomfortable you feel, and the more your body keeps going. The good news is that heat-triggered sweating has very clear management strategies that work.`

Crucially, this often fires in *anticipation* of a stressful situation, not just during it, which is why you might start sweating before a presentation or social event even begins. This isn't a character flaw or anxiety problem — it's a physical overreaction in your body's nervous system that responds well to specific techniques and treatments.`

      ? `Your body has learned to associate certain social situations with a sweating response — almost like a reflex that fires automatically. The part of your brain that stores memories of past uncomfortable episodes sends out a "prepare for sweating" signal before you've even walked into the room. Understanding this pattern is actually powerful, because it means you can intervene *before* it starts, not just react to it.`
