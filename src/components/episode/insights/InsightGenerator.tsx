      mechanism: `Studies show that hyperhidrosis has a huge impact on quality of life—sometimes even more than severe skin conditions like psoriasis. The constant "worry loop" (worrying about sweating, which causes more sweating) is a documented medical part of the condition, not a personality flaw.`,
      immediate: `Take a deep breath and remind yourself: your sweat glands are normal. It's just a signal glitch. You are not "disgusting" or "weird"—you're fighting a recognized medical condition.`,
      selfManagement: `Connecting with others who have hyperhidrosis can be life-changing. Check out the International Hyperhidrosis Society (sweathelp.org) for stories and support from people who truly get it.`,
      clinicalNote: `If you're feeling really down or avoiding social life because of this, please tell your doctor. They can provide support for the emotional side of the condition alongside the medical treatments. Both are equally important.`,
